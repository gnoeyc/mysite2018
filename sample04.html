                <h1>Fear and Loathing @ EDZ</h1>
                    <p>This is my personal review on the game Destiny 2 based on the XBox 1 console version. </p>
                    
                    <p>The campaign was really short and you will want to get through it as soon as possible to head towards the end game contents with your friends. There is when the true fun starts.</p>

                    <p>
                            Unfortunately fear and loathing kicks in when grinding for top-end rewards and loot. To maximise yield from Destiny you have to find time to play multiple hours a week to its Strikes and Raids, fingers crossed for good loot rewards â€“ which should not be taken granted.
                    </p>
                    <p>You can choose between 3 different classes, warlocks as a hybrid suppoorting class, titan as the tank and gunslinger as the typical scount character. They share common weapons but can be equiped with unique weapons.</p>
                            
                    <p>The shooting dynamics is fanastic, as you can expect from Bungie. </p>
